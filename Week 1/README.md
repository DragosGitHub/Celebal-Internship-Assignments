## Folder Structure

Each folder contains the `.py` solution file along with the corresponding HackerRank screenshot proving successful submission.

1. **Python Arithmetic Operators**  
   - Solved basic arithmetic operations problems.
2. **Compress the String**  
   - Implemented string compression using `itertools.groupby`.
3. **The Minion Game**  
   - Developed a game logic to determine the winner based on substrings starting with vowels or consonants.
4. **Write a Function**  
   - Practiced defining and calling Python functions.
5. **Iterables and Iterators**  
   - Calculated probabilities using combinations and filtering iterables.
6. **Python Tuples**  
   - Created tuples from input and computed their hash values.
7. **Finding the Percentage**  
   - Stored student marks and calculated average scores with precise formatting.
8. **Python String Formatting**  
   - Printed formatted decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary representations aligned properly.
