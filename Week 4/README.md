# üöÄ Week 4 Internship Report ‚Äì Celebal Technologies

---

## üìö Overview

Welcome to my **Week 4** internship progress report at **Celebal Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**!  
This week, I dived deeper into **SQL problem-solving** by tackling a variety of real-world data querying challenges on **HackerRank**. These problems involved a mix of statistical computations, joins, string filtering, and result formatting, giving me hands-on experience with practical SQL use cases.

---

## üìù Topics Covered

- **Joins & Filtering Logic:**  
  Mastered various types of joins and learned to apply complex filters across tables.

- **Aggregation Functions:**  
  Practiced using `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()` for analytical queries.

- **Mathematical & Geometric Calculations:**  
  Used functions like `POWER()` and `SQRT()` for computing Euclidean distance.

- **CASE Statements & Conditional Columns:**  
  Applied conditional display of columns using `CASE WHEN` for dynamic result formatting.

- **Window Functions:**  
  Implemented `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` to solve advanced queries like median and leaderboard rankings.

## üí° What I Learned

- Efficiently wrote **subqueries** and **nested conditions** inside `WHERE` and `JOIN` clauses.
- Improved ability to **sort conditionally** and **format** query outputs to match exact requirements.
- Understood **ranking logic** using aggregation and grouping for leaderboard challenges.
- Developed confidence in solving **real-world SQL problems** involving multiple tables and complex joins.

---

## üß© Challenges Faced

- **Multiple Filters on Joins:**  
  Challenges like "Ollivander's Inventory" required precise filtering within joins, which initially caused mismatches in output.

- **Conditional Naming with CASE:**  
  It took a few tries to correctly apply `CASE WHEN` logic while preserving sorting conditions, especially in the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù query.

- **Median Logic in SQL:**  
  Writing a median query without a direct `MEDIAN()` function required usage of window functions and careful indexing.

- **Leaderboard Aggregation:**  
  Summing only **maximum scores** per challenge for each hacker was tricky ‚Äî I had to group correctly and ensure no duplicates were included.

## üîö Summary

Week 4 gave me solid hands-on exposure to complex SQL topics, pushing me to write clean, efficient, and logically correct queries. These skills will directly support my growth in data engineering roles where real-world data pipelines rely heavily on SQL querying, especially in platforms like **Azure SQL**, **Databricks**, and **Apache Spark**.
